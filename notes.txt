Yijin: wide sweep 0.2, continue current course at 0 degree change until obstacle clears wide sweep
Andrew: building on Yijin, sharp memory of last known target, opposite of avoidance once cleared

May 8:
Andrew: What if we use our current avoid object, move opposite of object at high turn angle, and high velocity, burst to change course. 

Additional to our orginal, use the same angle and velocity back the opposite way of where we just went. once cleared obstacle.
So hold on to until continuous side object gone. then release the blast and clear the entry.

While (attempting obstacle avoid){
}
// released at this point, restoring blast opposite to our avoidance.
